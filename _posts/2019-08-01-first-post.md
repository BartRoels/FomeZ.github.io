This is my first post, how exciting!


While on vacation I was wondering how I could easily create a website where I could use markdown and github to publisch my upcoming blog posts. I already have some material ready, so stay tuned... 

Because it's also vacation I also need to unstress and game against my son on his Nintendo Switch.

btw I failed to win against my 7 year old boy :(
